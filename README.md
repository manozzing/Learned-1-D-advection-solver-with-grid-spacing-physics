# Learned-1-D-advection-solver-with-grid-spacing-physics
This repository contains Julia codes to emulate L94 advection scheme in 1-D. I am thinking about upload this repository for NeurIPS. Seems they didn't mandate one to upload the code and data, but they ask if one uploaded or not in the submission checklist... maybe better to upload I guess?
