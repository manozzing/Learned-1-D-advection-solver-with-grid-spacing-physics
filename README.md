# Learned 1D advection solver

## Introduction
This repository is a supplementary to the manuscript "**Learned 1-D advection solver to accelerate air quality modeling**." Basically this repository contains Julia codes in Jupyter Notebook to emulate L94 advection scheme in 1-D.

The aims of this project include:

* Develop a surrogate scheme of passive scalar advection with spatial and temporal coarse-graining
* Evaluate the performance of surrogate schemes in accuracy and computational speed
* Test the generalization ability of the learned scheme in the regime out of training dataset
